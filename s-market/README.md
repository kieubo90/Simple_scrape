**A Simple Scraping**

I created a chrome extension for this scraping. At the moment the extension can only work with this local market:

https://www.s-kaupat.fi/tuotteet/makeiset-ja-naposteltavat-1

Actually you can search on any product and upload this extension to your chrome browser and start using it to extract product's name and price.

Here is the short video of this code:
